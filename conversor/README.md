# Currency Converter Challenge

This project consists of developing a currency converter. It demonstrates how to work with currency exchange rates and provides practical experience in consuming APIs.

## Project Overview

The application is implemented as a console program that displays a menu and a welcome message.

- Users can select from multiple conversion options.

- The program accepts user input, such as converting 25 USD to Argentine Pesos or 250 BRL to USD, and outputs the resulting amount.

- The menu runs within a loop, allowing multiple conversions until the user decides to exit.

## Workflow

The project is organized using Trello and follows agile methodology:

- Columns include: Material, Backlog, In Progress, Paused, Completed.

- Each card represents a small task that contributes to completing the overall project.

- Initial tasks include: creating a GitHub repository, configuring the Java environment, and learning to consume the Exchange Rate API.

- The API requires an API key (free for a limited number of requests) to retrieve currency data.

- Additional optional tasks are available to enhance and customize the application.

## Learning Outcomes

Completing this project allows participants to practice:

- Java programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

- Working with APIs and JSON data.

- Using agile project management tools like Trello.

- Developing collaboration and project management skills applicable to real-world software development.
